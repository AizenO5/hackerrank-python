5.	Commonly used server error codes? [5XX] and few clients error code [4XX].
6.	Design prespective: if one endpoint GET /account/{accountId} connects to a database to fetch account information. What's the select query you would write ?(bonus) If the query returns zero row, what's the most suitable error code that you would choose for this scenario? [Hint: Since every row in the database table is considered a resource, suitable error code would be 404 -> HTTP:NOT_FOUND]
7.	What do you know about error mappings? If a requirement requires you map DB:TIMEOUT to HTTP:TIMEOUT, how would you do it?
•	Transforming data with Dataweave (2.0):
1.	Name few of the mime type that the dataweave can transform data from/to?
2.	(Only if you have worked with csv data format) If you have a flat file in CSV format, but uses '|' (pipe) as separator instead of the traditional ',' (comma) for business reason, then what's the reader property you would use to read the data from payload?
3.	(Only if you've worked with XML data). How to access attribute of an xml tag? How define namespace of custom xml tag? [Hint: @<attr_name> to access an attribute from an tag, use "ns" followed by the url for defining namespace]
4.	Input : A collection of employees,
[{"name": "nombre", "hours_logged" : 7}].
Write a datweave expression that would return true only if all the employees has logged greater than or equal to 8 hours. [Level2 : Now don't use the filter function] [Hint: Use the dw::core::Arrays::every function]
